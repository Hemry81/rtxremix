The Rough Only Generator script is a tool designed to apply a roughness (shiny material) effect to your Remix scene. Originally developed for GTASA and NFSU2 car materials.
This script proves to be valuable for games that generate random car texture hashes. It addresses the challenge of editing roughness values for unknown texture hashes, which can be time-consuming or even impossible to do individually.

# Installation:
Place the script into your game folder.

# How to use:
- To see a step-by-step demonstration and learn how to use the script effectively, please watch the following video.

- Usage of the "include_list.txt" file, which allows to manually add a few texture hashes to the "rough_only.usda" file without capturing the entire scene.
